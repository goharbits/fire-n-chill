The arbitrator may dismiss any arbitration brought without first proceeding through the informal dispute resolution conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.</p>

    <p><strong>Mediation.</strong> In the event the parties cannot resolve the Dispute via the informal dispute resolution conference, the Dispute must first be submitted to non-binding mediation before a neutral third party before it may proceed to arbitration. Selecting the mediator, the appropriate terms for mediation (including costs), and a date for mediation shall be negotiated in good faith between the parties. The administrative fees associated with mediation shall be negotiated between the parties, but you will not be required to pay any such fees that exceed those fees you would be required to pay if proceeding in a court of law. Such fees also will not include attorneys’ fees and costs, if any, unless awarded during mediation. If the parties cannot agree to appropriate terms concerning mediation, the parties shall be entitled to proceed with an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section. The arbitrator may dismiss any arbitration brought without first proceeding through the informal dispute resolution conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.</p>

    <p><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state, municipality, province or territory if the action is within that court’s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>

    <p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST FIRE & CHILL IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS.</p>

    <p><strong>MASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong> You and Fire & Chill agree that any Dispute between you shall be resolved only in an individual arbitration pursuant to this Section. You and Fire & Chill expressly waive the right to have any dispute, claim, or controversy brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated as a Mass Action, as defined below, and neither an arbitrator nor an arbitration provider shall have any authority to hear, arbitrate, or administer any Mass Action to award relief to anyone but the individual in arbitration, unless otherwise provided in this Section.</p>


    <p>
        <strong>Mass Action:</strong>
        "Mass Action" includes instances in which you or Fire & Chill are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms that has filed 25 or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against the other party within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on you or Fire & Chill’s behalf, and the law firm or collection of law firms seek to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all arbitration demands in the aggregate. Notwithstanding this Section, nothing prevents you or Fire & Chill from participating in a mass settlement of claims.
    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Special Master Appointment:</strong>
        In the event there is a dispute concerning the Mass Action Waiver, the parties agree to resolve such dispute before a Special Master appointed by the arbitration provider and agreed to between the parties. The Special Master shall have authority to resolve disputes concerning:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(i) filing fees owed with respect to any Mass Action;</li>
        <li>(ii) any dispute regarding whether this arbitration agreement has been followed;</li>
        <li>(iv) whether claimants are barred from proceeding with a Mass Action;</li>
        <li>(v) any dispute relating to the representation of the same claimant by multiple law firms;</li>
        <li>(vi) any dispute regarding discovery common to all claims; and</li>
        <li>(vii) any disputes regarding legal or factual issues common to all claims.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the Special Master determines you violated the Mass Action Waiver, either party shall have the opportunity to opt-out of arbitration within 30 days of the arbitrator’s decision. You may opt-out of arbitration by providing a written notice to <a href="mailto:{{ config('app.support_email') }}">{{ config('app.support_email') }}</a>. Fire & Chill may opt-out of arbitration by sending written notice of its intention to the arbitration provider and to you or your attorney, agent, or representative. For the avoidance of doubt, the ability to opt-out of arbitration at this stage in the proceedings only applies if the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators determines that you have violated the Mass Action Waiver. If the parties proceed with arbitration, the parties agree to the batching procedures below.
    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Batching:</strong>
        After proceedings before the Special Master have concluded, and to the extent any Mass Actions are permitted to proceed, the parties agree that Mass Actions will be batched into groups of no more than 200 demands per batch by state of residence (with any remaining demands batched into a single group). The parties shall inform the arbitrator of the batches and their composition within 14 calendar days of the conclusion of proceedings before the Special Master. The arbitrator provider shall treat each batch of claims as one case, with each case having one demand for arbitration, one appointed arbitrator, and one set of administrative documents and filing fees per batch. The parties shall randomly assign sequential numbers to each batch, and only one batch shall proceed to arbitration at a time in the order of the random sequential numbers. A separate arbitrator will be appointed to, and administrative and filings fees assessed for, each batch as the batch proceeds to arbitration.
    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Arbitration Procedure:</strong>

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Hearing Format:</strong>
        Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall take place in the State of Kentucky, but may proceed telephonically in the event the total amount of the claim does not exceed $2,500 U.S. dollars (if the claimant so chooses). In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, in any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Fire & Chill or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Fire & Chill is entitled.

The arbitrator may award relief, including but not limited to monetary, declaratory, injunctive or other equitable relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall briefly set forth the essential findings of fact and legal analysis. A judgment to enforce the award may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, however, any award that has been satisfied may not be filed or entered into court.
    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Binding Authority / Confidentiality:</strong>
        The parties agree that they are each waiving their right to a trial by jury to the maximum extent permitted by law, and that the arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.
